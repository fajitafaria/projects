		<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>This is a website dedicated to my favorite music. Music is a passion of mine and I would like to discuss and share my music recommendations.
			   On this website, you'll find; album reviews, top 10's, band spotlights, etc. My music taste varies through several genres, but I mainly enjoy 
			   rock and metal music. I hope I can introduce you to new music and artists that have influenced me. Most importantly, <strong>rock on!!</strong>
